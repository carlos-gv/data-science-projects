# Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a k-means clustering algorithm from scratch. Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can find patterns in your data. K-means is one of the most popular forms of clustering.

We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas. We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.

Plan implementation:

- Prepare the data to use.
- Code the k-means algorithm.
- Plot the result of the algorithm.
- Compare our algorithm to the scikit implementation.
